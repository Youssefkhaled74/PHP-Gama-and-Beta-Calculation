# Gamma and Beta Functions Calculator

This project allows users to calculate the Gamma and Beta functions using a simple web interface. 
It also provides explanations for these functions and outlines the steps of the integration process.

## How to Use
1. Enter the value for Gamma function (n) or Beta function (x and y).
2. Click "Calculate" to compute the results.
3. The program will display the values of Gamma(n) and Beta(x, y).

## How It Works
- The **Gamma Function** is calculated using the approximation that extends the factorial function.
- The **Beta Function** is computed using the relationship with the Gamma function.

## Technologies Used
- PHP for backend logic.
- HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end interface.
