# Gamma and Beta Functions Calculator

This PHP project calculates the Gamma and Beta functions based on user input. It includes a web interface built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive design. Additionally, it provides detailed explanations of the properties and integration steps for these mathematical functions.

## Features

- **Gamma Function Calculation**: Users can input a value to compute the Gamma function, which is an extension of the factorial function.
- **Beta Function Calculation**: Users can input two values to calculate the Beta function, defined in terms of the Gamma function.
- **Detailed Explanations**: The application provides explanations of the properties of both the Gamma and Beta functions.
- **Integration Steps**: Users can learn how these functions can be calculated using integration techniques.

## Files

- `index.php`: The main web interface for the application.
- `api.php`: An API endpoint for calculating the Gamma and Beta functions via JSON requests.
- `style.css`: Custom styles for the application, enhancing the user interface.
